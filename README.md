# Welcome!
## Was anybody else a bit traumatized by a certain flying nanny's tape measure?
### Neat. Let's see how you measure up!

*This is a short and simple quiz that is built to run in your command line.*

This quiz will not store any of your information - so if you want to save your results, take a screenshot. Or screen-grab. However you'd like to say it.

Also, this is just for fun. If you'd like to make this into a joke (it's totally possible and potentially hilarious), imagine that I am giggling along with you. You funny human, you!

## To take the quiz, clone this repo onto your device, navigate into the file, then type the following into your command line (this is called Terminal for macOS users):

# ruby quiz.rb
